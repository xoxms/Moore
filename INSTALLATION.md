# üë∑ Installation

Say you would want to contribute or tinker it and make your own bot,
but can not figure out how in da hell to set up without tons of error on your screen?

I got you! So I painstakingly write this documentation for you guys to follow!

# üìù Prerequisites

If you want to develop a program, you will need to install the program that install the program that make your program actually works!
So I listed all of them here, you can click to download it.

But before that, you would need a program, so-called [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
To put it simply, it is a program that we can edit our code, run, tests and debug (tests don't matter anyway).

There are many options such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is the most popular one.
Or if you are rich and can't manage your money properly, you would love [Jetbrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Below is the list of essential things that you **need** to build and run this project properly.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 16.9.0 or newer)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (or other node package manager)
- (\*) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- (\*) [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126)

`*` ‚Äî This can be installed with "Install Additional Tools for Node.js"
